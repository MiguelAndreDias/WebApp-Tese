# ADL to JSON Web App using Next.js

This web application is built using Next.js and is designed to showcase the conversion of openEHR Archetype Definition Language (ADL) files into valid JSON structures. The app utilizes the ckm repository to convert and display the corresponding JSON representations of the archetypes available.

## Project Overview
The ADL to JSON Web App provides an interactive interface for users visualize their ADL files and view the resulting JSON structures. The app utilizes the openEHR ADL to JSON converter algorithm to perform the conversion. Once a file is loaded, the app will display the JSON representation of the ADL archetype, organized into its various sections.
